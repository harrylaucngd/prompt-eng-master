Isopropanol,CC(C)O,"The molecular formula of Isopropanol, represented by the SMILES sequence CC(C)O, is C3H8O.",The molecular weight of Isopropanol (SMILES: CC(C)O) is approximately 60.1 g/mol.,The number of H-bond acceptors in Isopropanol (SMILES: CC(C)O) is 1. This is because the oxygen atom in the molecule can accept a hydrogen bond.,"As an AI, I don't have real-time access to databases or the ability to perform calculations. However, the logP value of Isopropanol (also known as 2-propanol) is typically reported to be around 0.05. This value represents the compound's lipophilicity, which influences its absorption and distribution within the body. Please verify this information from a reliable source or database.","I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to databases or the ability to perform calculations. Therefore, I can't provide the exact tPSA (Topological Polar Surface Area) for a specific molecule. I recommend using a reliable chemical database or software that can calculate this value.",N/A,N/A
