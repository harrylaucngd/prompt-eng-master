Vanillin,COc1cc(C=O)ccc1O,"The molecular formula for Vanillin, given its SMILES representation COc1cc(C=O)ccc1O, is C8H8O3.",The molecular weight of Vanillin is approximately 152.15 g/mol.,The number of H-bond acceptors in the molecule Vanillin is 3.,"1.31. The logP value of a compound is a measure of its lipophilicity, indicating how much it prefers to be in a lipid (fat) environment versus a water environment. A higher logP value means the compound is more lipophilic.",43.37 Å².,"I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to databases or the ability to perform calculations or predictions on specific chemical properties such as Apolar desolvation. I suggest consulting a specialized chemical database or software for this specific information.","I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to databases or the ability to perform calculations or predictions that aren't pre-programmed into my capabilities. I can't provide the Polar desolvation (kcal/mol) for specific molecules. I recommend consulting a specialized chemical database or software for this information."
Cyclohexane,C1CCCCC1,The molecular formula of Cyclohexane is C6H12.,The molecular weight of Cyclohexane is approximately 84.16 g/mol.,"0. Cyclohexane does not have any hydrogen bond acceptors because it does not contain any nitrogen, oxygen or fluorine atoms.","3.44. The logP value of Cyclohexane is 3.44, which indicates that it is significantly more hydrophobic than Isopropanol.","The tPSA (Topological Polar Surface Area) of Cyclohexane, which has the SMILES notation C1CCCCC1, is 0 Å². This is because Cyclohexane is a non-polar molecule and does not have any polar functional groups that would contribute to a polar surface area.","I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to databases or the ability to perform calculations or predictions related to specific chemical properties such as Apolar desolvation. My main function is to provide information based on pre-existing knowledge. For specific and up-to-date information, I recommend consulting a reliable database or a professional in the field.","I'm sorry for any confusion, but as an AI, I don't have real-time access to databases or the ability to perform calculations or predictions on specific chemical properties such as Polar desolvation.
