However, I can assist you in understanding the general factors that influence solubility.\n\nSolubility is influenced by various factors, including molecular structure, polarity, and temperature. Generally, compounds with polar functional groups, such as hydroxyl (-OH) or amino (-NH2) groups, tend to be more soluble in water. On the other hand, nonpolar compounds, such as those with long hydrocarbon chains, are often less soluble.\n\nTo determine the solubility of a specific compound, it is necessary to consult reliable experimental data or solubility databases. These sources provide measured solubility values under specific conditions.",
