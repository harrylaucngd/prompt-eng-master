The LogP value needs to be calculated using appropriate software or databases that can predict the LogP value based on the molecular structure.",
                "Drugability (Yes or No)": "It is not possible to determine the drugability of a small molecule based solely on its name and SMILES representation. Additional information such as its pharmacological properties, target interactions, and bioavailability would be required to determine its drugability."

By examining the SMILES, we can identify the atoms that can accept hydrogen bonds.\n\nIn this molecule, there are 3 atoms that can act as H-bond acceptors: the two oxygen atoms (O) and the nitrogen atom (N) in the nitro groups.
